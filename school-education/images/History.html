    <p> Notre Dame – RVM College of Cotabato has its beginning from the Escuela Catolica founded by the Beatas (now R.V.M. Sisters) S. Isabel Cero Mojado, S. Valentina Lorenzo, S. Filomina Galos and S. Severina Santos who were sent by the Superior General of the Beatas, Reverend Efigenia Alvarez, in 1904. The first classes were held at the home of Don Antonio and Doña Eusebia Sousa, the generous benefactors of the Sisters.

In 1917, the school obtained the government recognition and was granted the authority to issue certificates to the elementary school graduates. The subject taught were Christian Doctrines, Reading and Writing, Drawing and Painting, and the Home Arts for Girls. Until 1911, all instructions were in Spanish. When English became the medium of instruction, Spanish continued to be taught as a subject in all classes of all levels.

The school underwent several name changing from Escuela Catolica to Escuela de San Antonio, Colegio de los Corazones Y Maria and finally Cotabato Parochial School which it bore until World War II stopped its operation.</p>
    <p>After the war, the sisters organized pre-school and elementary classes under the name St. Anthony School. S. Maria Aquino secured spaces for classes in the ground floor of friends and benefactors, which the school used until the old school was rebuilt.</p>
    <p>In 1947, Archbishop Mongeau, then the O.M.I. Father Superior, founded the Notre Dame of Cotabato a co-educational Catholic High School which in 1948 was separated into Boys Department and Girls Department. The Marist Bothers, taking over the Boys remained in the original site of the sister&rsquo;s school. The RVM Sisters under the leadership of Sister M. Isabel Purification, RVM moved to the present site where the elementary school and high school for girls were fused into the Notre Dame of Cotabato &ndash; Girls Department which later became Notre Dame of Cotabato for Girls in 1979.</p>
    <p>In the School Year 1969 &ndash; 1974, to meet the standard of its clientele, an additional building was constructed in the campus, which was named as Mother Tan Building. This served as the mini-auditorium, where school programs such as stage plays, operettes, etc. were held and at the same time served as the classrooms of the high school students.</p>
    <p>In the School Year 1986 &ndash; 1990, as a response to the rapid increase in the school&rsquo;s population, the administrators, under the able leadership of S. Ma. Remedios P. Reduta, RVM and S. Ma. Anecita C. Navaja, RVM, received blessings from its benefactors most specially from Rev. Archbishop Philip Smith, OMI, DD, hence, the Archbishop Philip Smith Building (BSB1, BSB2), were constructed and serve as the High School Department Buildings.</p>
